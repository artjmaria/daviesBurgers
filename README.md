Davie's Burgers: In this project, I followed step-by-step instructions to fix a fictional restaurant's website. While the HTML was in place, the box model properties needed attention. Using my knowledge of height, width, padding, border, and margin, I successfully completed the task, ensuring a well-structured and visually appealing website.
